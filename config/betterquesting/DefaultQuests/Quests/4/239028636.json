      "desc:8": "§bHydrogen§r is an essential resource in any oil refining operation, as it is required for §9hydrocracking§r, §edesulfurization§r, and the production of high quality fuel \u0026 lubricant feedstocks and additives. There are a variety of sources of hydrogen, listed below.\n\n- Coal pyrolysis is an excellent source of syngas, which can then be reformed and separated into hydrogen using a PSA.\n- Partial oxidation of unutilized oil fractions can also be a good source of syngas for hydrogen.\n- Steam reforming fuel gas, natural gas, and methane is another source of syngas.\n- Lastly, the catalytic reforming of heavy naphtha also provides hydrogen directly.",
